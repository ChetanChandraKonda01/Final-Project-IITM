## **Project 1: Sequence-to-Sequence Modeling with Attention Mechanism**

### **Overview**
The goal of this project is to implement a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model with an attention mechanism to predict a target sequence (reversed version of the input sequence). The project highlights the importance of attention in improving model performance.

### **Skills Gained**
- Sequence-to-sequence modeling
- Attention mechanisms
- PyTorch implementation for NLP tasks
- Model evaluation and performance analysis

### **Approach**
1. Synthetic dataset generation: Random sequences of integers where the target is the reverse of the input.
2. Implemented seq2seq model with an attention mechanism using PyTorch.
3. Trained and evaluated the model using loss and accuracy metrics.

### **Business Use Cases**
- Machine Translation Systems
- Text Summarization Tools
- Chatbots and Conversational AI

### **Results**
- Loss curves and model accuracy on synthetic data.
- Demonstration of the attention mechanismâ€™s impact on performance.
